# Ebook-Reader

This project aims to create a solid file reader for common book and comic book file extensions. 

At the moment it can read .txt files, however I expect it to read .epub files by the end of November 2022.
I have spent weeks setting up the GUI and other parts of the software which are necessary, but which are not the focus of this project. 
Main menu, fetching files from folders the user picks, creting widgets for files and sorting them and a few other basic functionalities have already been set up.
Other functionalities such as file details and a list of scannable folders should be implemented by the end of the year.

For now, my main focus is getting this programme to work on computers, especially recent versions of Windows. 
However, the GUI code is wrtitten in Kivy module, so with a few changes, the code should work on Android too. 
Though, compatibility with other operating systems is low priority at the moment.

As a second year college student, I would like to test my programming skills and as someone who reads a lot, I would like to use a solid file reader software.
Since I feel like I have a decent understanding of C++ already, I have chosen to create this project in a language unfamiliar to me - Python.
